# 🎓 AI Placement Prediction System

An AI-based web application that predicts a student’s placement probability based on academic performance, skills, and aptitude using Machine Learning techniques.

The system helps understand how factors like CGPA, internships, projects, aptitude score, and communication skills influence placement outcomes.

## 🚀 Project Description

The **AI Placement Prediction System** uses a Machine Learning classification model to analyze student data and predict whether a student has a high or low chance of getting placed.

The project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Cross-validation
- Real-time prediction through a Flask web application

This project is built for **academic learning and demonstration purposes**.

## 📊 Model Details

- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler  
- **Evaluation Method:** Cross-Validation  
- **Accuracy:**  


> ⚠️ Note:  
> The dataset used is **synthetic and linearly separable**, which results in very high accuracy.  
> In real-world placement datasets, accuracy would be lower due to noise and variability.
