# 🎓 AI Placement Prediction System

A full-stack Machine Learning web application that predicts a student’s placement probability based on academic and skill-based inputs.
The system is built using Python, Flask, and Logistic Regression, and is deployed live on Render.


🚀 Live Demo

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a real-world placement prediction system where a student can enter their academic details and receive a placement probability along with a visual progress bar.

The application focuses not only on model accuracy but also on:

User experience

Clear probability interpretation

Real deployment of an ML model


✨ Features

. 📊 Predicts placement probability (%)

. 🧠 Machine Learning model trained using Logistic Regression

. 📈 Probability shown using a dynamic progress bar

. 🎨 Premium glassmorphism UI with dark & light mode

. 🌐 Deployed live using Render

. 📦 Clean project structure (industry-style)
